### MongoDB aggregation pipeline 

- Operational Semantics – the execution of the language is described directly. 
- Denotational Semantics – each phrase in the language is interpreted as a conceptual meaning that can be thought of abstractly. 
- Axiomatic Semantics – meaning to phrases is given by describing the logical axioms that apply to them.
